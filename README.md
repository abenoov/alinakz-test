## How to run the project with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## How to run the project locally

### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the development server

To start the development server and run your React application, use the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the development server, and you should see a message like "running at:" followed by the local development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your web browser to view your React application.
